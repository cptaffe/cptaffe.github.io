	<h3>Language interpreter</h3>
	<p>
		Now the third generation of Basilisk, a language based on lisp. This version is implemented in python and includes expression-by-expression evaluation: <a href='//github.com/cptaffe/lispy'>lispy</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a more in depth overview, check out this <a href="./lispy">talk</a>.

	<h3>Mesher</h3>
	<p>
		STL editor written completely in JS: <a href='./Mesher'>Mesher</a>. Uses THREE.js and around 1k lines for undo/redo, some simple tools, etc. Haven't worked on it in a while and it is still a bit buggy.

	<h3>Markdown Editor</h3>
	<p>
		Markdown preview page, made awesome with Bootstrap: <a href='./bootstrap'>editor</a>. It dynamically updates the rendered html to match your markdown input, has a couple of save and update key-combos (useful if dynamic-update is turned off becuase document is too long). It also saves to your local memory, keeping the last document the next time you go to the page. Basically a legitimate app with no server-side code whatsoever.

	<h3>CSS Zen Thingy</h3>
	<p>
		Example of my awesome CSS skills: <a href='./css-zen'>css zen</a> (<a href="https://github.com/cptaffe/css-zen/">github</a>). Mouse over the menus for the cool part (no js).
		Images are given proper citation on the github page to the best of my ability.
