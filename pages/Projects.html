	<h3>Markdown Editor</h3>
	<p>
		Markdown preview page, made awesome with Bootstrap: <a href='./bootstrap'>editor</a>. It dynamically updates the rendered html to match your markdown input, has a couple of save and update key-combos (useful if dynamic-update is turned off becuase document is too long). It also saves to your local memory, keeping the last document the next time you go to the page. Basically a legitimate app with no server-side code whatsoever.
