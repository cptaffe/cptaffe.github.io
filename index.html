				<h1 class="page-header">Hello, World!</h1>

				<p>
					Hello, I am a computer science student currently attending <a href="//ualr.edu/computerscience/">UALR</a>, this page is a listing of some of my <a href="//github.com/cptaffe">projects</a>.
				</p> <p>
					To contact me, use my <a href="mailto:cpaynetaffe@gmail.com">email</a>, my Google+ at <a href="//google.com/+ConnorTaffe">+ConnorTaffe</a>, my <a href="//linkedin.com/pub/connor-taffe/9a/241/7b0/en">LinkedIn</a>, or just have a browse through my <a href="//cptaffe.github.com/resume/resume.pdf">resume</a> and my open source projects on <a href="//github.com/cptaffe">github</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					These projects represent just a few of my interests. Recently I've pursued lower level coding in C, C++, and (x86/x86_64) assembly languages for projects involving bootable operating system-style programs and compilers/interpreters. Note that many of these projects were educational experiences which represent first delves into their respective fields.

				<div class="project-pane" id="ieee-vr">
					<h1>IEEE VR Talk</h1>
					<p>
						The <a href="//github.com/cptaffe/ieee_vr">IEEE VR Talk</a> repository contains the slides my colleagues and I at UALR's Emerging Analytic Center presented at 2015's IEEE Virtual Reality conference in Arles, France. Under Dr. Carolina Cruz-Niera, we presented a series of slides outlining how to integrate Vuforia, OpenCV, and Unity to build Virtual and Augmented reality applications with the Unity game engine and interface.
					</p> <p>
						The talk itself is written using the <a href="//lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a> framework and markdown for content representation.
					</p> <p>
						The talk and materials can be found <a href="//byteflame.org/ieee_vr/">here</a>.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="project-pane" id="lispy">
					<h1>lispy</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/lispy">Lispy</a> is a lisp-like language interpreter written in Python. The language is specifically known as Basilisk, and is of my own devising.
					</p> <p>
						The repository includes sample functions in <code>std/math</code>, including <code>math:!</code>. To import them, just do:
					</p>
					<div class="editor" id="lispyEditor"></div>
					<script>
					$(document).ready(function () {
						editors.newEditor("lispyEditor", function (editor) {
								editor.getSession().setValue("(import std:math)\n=> (nil math:! math:^ math:square math:cube)\n(math:! 4)\n=> 24");
								editor.getSession().setMode("ace/mode/lisp");
						});
					});
					</script>
					<p>
						The code for the factorial (<code>!</code>) function is this: <code>(: math:! (@ (n) (if n 1 (* n (self (- n 1))))))</code>. It recursively checks if n is 1, multiplying n by the result of recursing with n - 1.
					</p><p>
						The evalutation portion of the interpreter is written monadically, returning a tuple containing a function pointer and the arguments to that function for each function. This way, the evaluator recurses only once for every source recursion.
					</p><p>
						It does nice error reporting by saving the line and character location for each token and printing said info when an error is found. In this particular interpreter, I used a coroutine-based model without using coroutines by having each piece save state in its own structure and on subsequent calling pick up where it left off.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="project-pane" id="css-zen">
					<h1>CSS Zen</h1>
					<p>
						The idea behind the <a href="//www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen</a> challenge is to style a page with as much functionality as CSS can provide. My attempt at this challenge can be seen <a href="//byteflame.org/css-zen">here</a>, you can find the repo with my css code <a href="//github.com/cptaffe/css-zen">here</a>.

				<div class="project-pane" id="mesher">
					<h1>Mesher</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/Mesher/">Mesher</a> is a client-side web application for rendering, editing, and saving 3D printable stls. It uses the newest web technologies and libraries such as THREE.js, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
					</p> <p>
						It is a modular applicaton written in JS, with support for multiple models, views, and projects. Each object stores its state in some data structure, allowing many instances of each to exist simultaneosly. Although not currently used, the api can support tabbed editor panes for each model. Multiple models on the same canvas are well supported and the undo-redo stack has been written to accomidate these states.

				<div class="project-pane" id="uft8">
					<h1>bf</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/bf">bf</a> is a just-in-time (jit) compiler for the "BrainFuck" langauge. It uses a similar approach in the lexer-parser, using a concurrent, threaded approach which uses a mutex'd queue to pass tokens from the lexer to the evaluator. For this particular compiler, I did not write a tree-based evaluator, but an jit component.
					</p> <p>
						The jit compiler produces 64-bit instructions which it writes to an executable page, executing each full statement, which modifies some allocated memory. The jit uses one-byte operation isntructions, and uses one-byte registers for these operations, but keeps the current memory pointer in <code>rsi</code> for quick access and modification. At the end of each execution, the state is saved, moving <code>rsi</code> into a memory location in the jit structure. At the beginning of the next statement execution, this state is restored, keeping a persistent state for every execution.
					</p> <p>
						The following is a statement in BrainFuck; it adds 4, moves left 2, and adds 4:
					</p>
					<div class="editor" id="bfEditor"></div>
					<script>
					$(document).ready(function () {
						editors.newEditor("bfEditor", function (editor) {
								editor.getSession().setValue("++++>>++++");
						});
					});
					</script>
					<p>
						The program reports the exec page contains the following insructions: <code>exec: { 0x48, 0xbe, 0x0, 0x20, 0xf9, 0x8, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x80, 0x6, 0x4, 0x48, 0x83, 0xc6, 0x2, 0x80, 0x6, 0x4, 0x48, 0x89, 0xf0, 0x48, 0xa3, 0xc8, 0x4d, 0x40, 0x68, 0xba, 0x7f, 0x0, 0x0, 0xc3 }</code>; and the following memory state after execution: <code>mem: { 4, 0, 4, 0, 0 }[2]</code>.
					</p><p>
						This means that index 0 and 2 were increment 4 times, and that the last indice (position of <code>rsi</code>) is 2.
					</p> <p>
						The following is some dissassembly output from the above executable instructions:
					</p>
					<div class="editor" id="bfDumpEditor"></div>
					<script>
					$(document).ready(function () {
						editors.newEditor("bfDumpEditor", function (editor) {
							editor.getSession().setValue(".data:0x00000000	48be0020f90801000000	movabs rsi,0x108f92000\n.data:0x0000000a	800604	add    BYTE PTR [rsi],0x4\n.data:0x0000000d	4883c602	add    rsi,0x2 ; char* dst = arg[0]\n.data:0x00000011	800604	add    BYTE PTR [rsi],0x4\n.data:0x00000014	4889f0	mov    rax,rsi ; dst[i] = c\n.data:0x00000017	48a3c84d4068ba7f0000	movabs ds:0x7fba68404dc8,rax\n.data:0x00000021	c3	ret");
							editor.getSession().setMode("ace/mode/assembly_x86");
						});
					});
					</script>
				</div>

				<div class="project-pane" id="utf8">
					<h1>utf8</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/utf8">utf8</a> is a utf-8 parser written in C. It has a useful interface featuring <code>utf8_rune utf8_encode(const int32_t cp)</code> and <code>int32_t utf8_decode(const utf8_rune rune)</code> functions for encoding and decoding runes. There is also a <code>utf8_parser</code> and related functions for parsing utf-8 characters from a string, as well as a validation function.
					</p> <p>
						Safety was not taken lightly in <b>utf8</b> and several error values exist for types. <code>int32_t</code>'s treated as code-points are a maximum of 21 bits in length, opening all negative numbers for error values, so <code>utf8_CP_INVALID</code> and <code>utf8_CP_ERROR</code> are used to indicate invalid runes (in conversion) and other program errors. With runes, there are the values <code>0xf5</code> to <code>0xff</code> are invalid, and are thusly used for rune errors with the constants <code>utf8_RUNE_INVALID</code>, <code>utf8_RUNE_ERROR</code>, and <code>utf8_RUNE_SHORT</code>. These are used to indicate the same errors as the associated codepoint errors, except that <code>SHORT</code> is used to indicate a rune cannot be lexed for lack of length (only returned from functions doing this).
					</p> <p>
						I took some pains to write complete comments so the source should be quite well documented. It complies with RFC 3629 as much as possible, and checks for and handles errors properly. Compiling with <code>make test</code> invokes the test program, also written in C, which does a series of calls and stress tests, reporting if anything failed with plenty of debugging information. If a test failed, <code>make</code> will fail.
					</p>
					<p>Here's some example code using <b>utf8</b>:</p>
					<div class="editor" id=utf8Editor></div>
					<script>
					$(document).ready(function () {
						editors.newEditor("utf8Editor", function (editor) {
								editor.getSession().setValue("int32_t codepoint = 0x5555;\nutf8_rune rune = utf8_encode(codepoint);\nprintf(\"U+%X->%#x=%.4s\\n\", utf8_decode(rune), rune,  (char *) &rune);");
								editor.getSession().setMode("ace/mode/c_cpp");
						});
					});
					</script>

					<h2>utf8plus</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/utf8plus">utf8plus</a> is a C++ wrapper for the <b>utf8</b> repo. It provides a <b>utf8</b> namespace and a <b>rune</b> class.
						</p> <p>
							The rune class has two static instantiator methods, <code>encode</code> and <code>get</code>. Encode takes an <code>int32_t</code> codepoint and encodes it to a rune, returning the instantiated rune (created using rune's constructor, which takes an int32_t encoded utf8). Get takes a <code>void *</code> to a memory location and a <code>size_t</code> which conveys the size, a utf8 rune is lexed from the beginning of this memory, if the memory is too short, an exception of type <code>rune::exception</code> with a <code>code</code> attribute of type <code>rune::exception::errcode</code> and value <code>SHORT</code> All rune functions will use this exception and either raise <code>SHORT</code> or <code>INVALID</code>. If something was interpretted as an <code>utf8_CP_ERROR</code> or <code>utf8_RUNE_ERROR</code> in the <b>utf8</b> package, a <code>logic_error</code> will be thrown here.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rune class methods include <code>decode</code>, which returns an <code>int32_t</code> whose value is a code-point; <code>isvalid</code> which returns a bool indicating whether the rune is a valid utf-8 rune; and <code>len</code>, which returns the length of the rune in bytes.
					</p>
					<p>Here's a simple translation of the first example:</p>
					<div class="editor" id=utf8plusEditor></div>
					<script>
					$(document).ready(function () {
						editors.newEditor("utf8plusEditor", function (editor) {
								editor.getSession().setValue("int32_t codepoint = 0x5555;\nutf8::rune rune = utf8::rune::encode(codepoint);\nprintf(\"U+%X->%#x=%.4s\\n\", rune.decode(), rune.value,  (char *) &rune.value);");
								editor.getSession().setMode("ace/mode/c_cpp");
						});
					});
					</script>

					<p>This summary does not do justice to either, so check out the code for <a href="//github.com/cptaffe/utf8">utf8</a> and <a href="//github.com/cptaffe/utf8plus">utf8plus</a>.</p>

				<div class="project-pane" id="lex">
					<h1>lex</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/lex">lex</a> is an implementation of a monadic state machine framework written in C. It has a lex structure with related methods and is thusly object-oriented. This code allows for the running of a state-machine which keeps track of state via function pointers. These function pointers are called until one or more tokens are avaliable on the queue, then one is returned. On subsequent calls, the queue is checked for tokens, and if it is empty, the state machine is run.
					</p> <p>
						The ideas behind my lexer come from a talk on the go lexer, that video can be found <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE">here</a>.

				</div>

				<div class="project-pane" id="shunting-yard">
					<h1>shunting yard</h1>
					<p>
						<a href="//github.com/cptaffe/shunting-yard">shunting yard</a> is a program that parses an infix expression and returns the result using Dijkstra's shunting yard algrorithm. This program was a test of building with the <a href ="//code.google.com/p/gyp/">gyp</a> build system.
